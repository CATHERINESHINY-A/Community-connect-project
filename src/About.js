            <li><p>The institute is regarded for its high-quality entrance exam preparation and produces remarkable results every year. At Point Academy, we focus on building a strong foundation for students and provide them with an excellent platform for the preparation of competitive as well as board-level examination.</p></li>
            <li><p>Point Academy has a systematic testing system in place which helps us assess the knowledge attained by our students and identify the areas of improvement. A series of tests and examinations are conducted each fortnight and at the end of the term for each of our courses to evaluate our students and prepare them well to face scholarship, medical & engineering entrance exams. The system functions in a transparent manner and parents can easily track their wardâ€™s performance and attendance in the class. Parents are also informed about the result of tests and absenteeism of their ward via App.</p></li>
            <li><p>The feedback system at Point Academy works well not just for the students but also for all the staff members. Each of the student and staff members is given an internal mailing ID using which they can write to the Managing Director.</p></li>
            <li><p>Over the years, it is seen that the system has evolved. Everything, right from lecture plans to course content, test schedules to the examination system, parent-teacher meetings to the selection of faculty members, is anticipated to be planned in advance for the academic year.</p></li>
